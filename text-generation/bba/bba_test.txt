High-key UP is a gem of a human being

Hey, if someone submits something personal and heartfelt to BBA, can we not tag our friends in it, comment things like "Me" or "Did you post this," or otherwise treat it like a meme and invalidate that person's experience? It probably took them guts to submit it, and if I were to do something like that, I wouldn't want other people making light of my questions because they wanted to meme with their friends.

I wish riley p would ask me out

To be honest, I really want to have a crush on someone... but also I'm probably gay and I feel like it'll be hard too...

Something feels different between us this semester habibi, but I'm not sure how to tell you...

I watched Yerma today and my only regret was not seeing it earlier so I could tell other people to go see it because of how incredible it was. The cast and show literally took my breath away - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time even without fully knowing the premise of the show. Yerma (Erica Alonso - can we talk about how talented she is????) was portrayed with so much emotion there was never a boring part in the play. Daniel Kushner, Leo Tamez, Alonnie Johnson, Sammie Chomsky, Carmen Ferran, Marissa Alfiero, Liesl Jaeger, Halley McArn, Sam Blustein, Roysworth Grant (please forgive me if I forgot anyone) as well as the entire production team, you guys are such gems on campus and I can't begin to describe how impressed I am.

Above all, I just wanted to point out really Duncan Gallagher's genius for directing and translating this show, for putting his heart and effort into this and everything he does. It really is something to be proud of and an unforgettable experience."

What should I do if I submitted a BBA to my crush and he responded with "hit me up" but my self-esteem is too low not to think I'll be laughed at and rejected? Help a semi-closeted guy out.

will Caymus please be my cuddle-buddy?

The real question is how do I successfully approach Brendan Gaffney

wow yeah i'm just having a terrible time this week but i super appreciate everyone who's been so caring and patient with me you're all amazing thanks so much <3

At this point, I just want to fall asleep on Andrew Baker's chest and feel his beard against my cheeks...

Jordan Hartzell is so gorgeous, single?

Lots of guys here express interest in fucking me but none ever seem interested in actually dating/developing a relationship. What do I do - I'm so fed up with drunk hookups. Every so often I'll think I have a genuine romantic connection with a guy, and every time he'll either ghost, reveal he has a girlfriend, or start hooking up with one of my friends. A couple have shot to combine all three! **Is there a way to scout out guys who want more than a one-night-stand/one of my friends/alternative to their girlfriend?** Clearly I am going about this wrong. How do I become one of the chosen who escape the trap? It's really starting to get to me.

I just want Drew Hawkinson to embrace me the way he was carrying those stage lights at strike

George Kubai, what's a girl gotta do?

How do people looking for hookups feel about being asked out on a date? Would you turn a girl down?

cw for sexual assault, coercion, etc
Are there any resources/groups on campus for students who haven't necessarily gone through sexual assault in a prosecutable sense, but have experienced sexual coercion/lack of continual consent/sex that has felt unsafe? It's been difficult to figure out how to talk about my experiences without feeling like I'm taking space away from survivors of other forms of sexual trauma:("

Shoutout to the cute guy rocking the oversized striped shirt/orange sweater look in the Daebak show Friday night! Who are you and where can I find you??

Not really an admirers post, but I hope everyone here reaches the end of college without feeling like a failure like I do. Make the most of it. Learn to love yourself.

Marissa Rose Alfiero has so much love to give, it's as if she had enough love for a thousand soul mates.

Addie lerner and thomas walker are the royal couple we deserve. All hail the presidents #RollKD

One of the first things I did at Brown was majorly crush on Hannah Velasquez. She doesn't know me at all, but damn it's senior year now and I wish I got to know her and approach her!

Is there a senior out there who is 1) selling a mattress 2) going to be here at the start of june and 3) would be willing to deliver this mattress to a house on wickenden on June 1? Obviously I would pay extra for delivery and extra extra if you moved it up the stairs of my house. I would do this myself but I'm not gonna be here and my subletter needs a bed! Help a gal out!!!

Isabel Blalock: We're not friends (we've taken similar classes), but I just wanted to say that I really admire you! You're a really confident person with a big heart. You're really motivated and passionate about the work you've done in public health. Keep on being you because you're someone who's going to do amazing stuff in the future!

Can we please just give the biggest shout out to the entire CS195y course staff for being such wonderful, kind, positive and helpful people?! I can't state enough how much I appreciate the ways in which you're all so helpful, from answering piazza posts late at night / last minute, to spending your last semesters once again bushed with TAing (Sorawee especially), and Aaron for getting bushed staying late alone several times to help us all out when homework is due, and Emma, Harriet, Jack, Alex, Sophia, Brittany, Zach, Ben, and everyone, especially Tim, each and every one of you is so appreciated.

You ever spend too much time inside holed up in your room with the shades down? Then you walk outside and it's warm and the sky is blue and this ray of sunshine washes across your face and a feeling of contentedness bubbles up inside you? That was what it was like watching the Jabberwocks perform. Congrats on a great show y'all!

PSA for all TWINS: Twins are rad, but often it's hard to be friends with them because they are so close you can feel like it's impossible to become their BFF. Often friends of twins feel like an outsiter (you've experienced 20 years of life together) and it's normal that you're so close‚Äîbut be aware to make space for others.

Hey friend,

Thanks for 40 mn straight conversation. I can't imagine I could stand this long looking your lips while u were talking (that's one reason I distanced myself most of the times). I'm not into anything intimate for now, but I would love to spend more times with you as a friend. I sent a message after our first encounter 210 days ago, but it went unanswered. I am writing this post after our second one to appreciate your times and friendliness, nothing expected in return though."

""The Eskimos have 52 words for snow because it is so special to them; there ought to be as many for love."" - Margaret Atwood
In spite of that poorly wrought myth, we will try to describe...
1. love, n. A feeling or disposition of deep affection or fondness for someone, typically arising from a recognition of attractive qualities, from natural affinity, or from sympathy and manifesting itself in concern for the other's welfare and pleasure in his or her presence (distinguished from sexual love at sense 4a); great liking, strong emotional attachment; (similarly) a feeling or disposition of benevolent attachment experienced towards a group or category of people, and (by extension) towards one's country or another impersonal object of affection. [OED]
2. love, v. To do all that ^. To do anything, for that ^ is an assumption of atoms.
3. Oh, do we dare? Is it not an affront? We tremble to voice it. ""How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love? You cannot do it to save your life. You can describe things, but you can't tell them."" [Nina]
4. First: MIRACLE MOST HOLY, MIRACLE MOST ORDINARY.
5. The first time you fall in love, you've been told about it so many times it doesn't come as a surprise. You are told how to feel. And yet the warmth. Incomparable. Everything below a myth.
6. To begin with a look, a touch, a premonition. Maybe time must go by first. Then you see if they hold you, if that unsuspecting pile of flesh and bones somehow reverberates.
7. Or not! It could start a thousand ways, with more than one person, love multiplied x-fold (tough, in a limited list like this, to include every avatar of this endless word. I hope to avoid offense).
8. Agreement on the magic when it starts; our hearts beg for the beginning. Why is the heart love's chosen organ? Did the ancients know that love is a condition of our blood, a streaming, warm, liquid-based endeavor?
9. Impossible challenge: find something lovelier than the body, which in each shape and form engenders my gratitude. "The contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well. All things please the soul, but these please the soul well." [Walt]
10. When I embraced it was a coming home; fire unmitigated, as though every part were preordained to find its primordial half. I am sorry for the burns.
11. Above all the eyes; for to look face to face at that which was created alongside me is a reminder of our holy covenant:
12. Is it unreasonable, despite a textual lack, to imagine that God's fifth word, a command, was "Love!"? YHWH gave me light, contingent on me emanating love. For you and you and you.
13. "What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?" [George]
14. Some are fortunate enough to experience love from the Parent; this, I imagine, is a love that knows no bounds. Will revise if I can parthenogenerate.
15. No greater Parent than the multitudinous all-Father or all-Mother; the limit, for them, does not exist. Love with the largest capital L.
16. Quit the Kum-Ba-Yah: love is nothing but my organs wanting to enmesh with other organs. Hot and messy.
17. What I love most is a clean, well-wrapped burrito at the end of a long day of work, with a curated, laugh out loud sitcom episode (my favorite: "Threat Level Midnight").
18. You brutes! Love is most evident in friendship, which, untainted by the inevitable organ enmeshing that romance entails, is the highest expansion of our souls. Friend, I will be behind your shoulder, ever.
19. Love not singularly, but communally, for being enveloped in love, to be one among many is to offer our arm to something substantial.
20. Love is not nationalism, not even patriotism; love for the country is an ever-rising urge to better it, not to adore it. One does not love one's child by doting on it.
21. The greatest love is for a place. Street corners imbued with the memory of a heartbreak, a laugh, a night. What is love if not a subsuming, a consummated familiarity with the drab?
22. A long-distance friend tests us; how far is your love? To laze around in class, daydream in the dazzling leaves, and imagine your eyes share this sun. "No matter then although my foot did stand / Upon the furthest earth removed from thee" (Will).
23. To be baffled by your own blindness. To feel all day a rumbling. To melt away the voices and concerns besides that of the beloved. To confess, and to be‚Ä¶
24. Received. If you get here, take a look at the room. Every object, every place will hold a claim on your heart.
25. Rejected. If you get here, take a look at the room. It'll be awkward to look at the other person.
26. Then, if you are holy, watch it reify, and the rush still hits you, but more--it forms you; a rock. Mutual cognizance, respect, support. Now you have found the Other, and you may begin your life together; now you may grow, one with each other (asymmetry is problematic).
27. On a sunny spring day you may be joined midst fragrant flowers; to codify, to sanctify, with the blessing of a hundred hands, what never really needed it, for it was apparent at the commencement. We foolishly count from this day; marriage starts when the hearts collapse.
28. May you be blessed with only one, but if not, repeat 23-27 till exhaustion.
29. ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å | Binigyan mo ako ng lahat.
30. Much, much more than just a spark between people; nay, it undergirds everything we do. To [ ] is to love.
31. Certainly it is a universal feeling, since I fell in love with you. You crept into the cracks between my toes. I am you. You are in my Jell-O, in my skies.
32. You went down to the place we used to go to revive my soul. It was closed.
33. When love has passed, it becomes a timid ember: pulsating limply, annoyingly brought back by dreams.
34. A few of my favorite things: Skittles, my old high school, popcorn at the movies, the long-gone turquoise-colored truck, shrimp, finding refuge from the winter chills. Not to get sappy, too personal:
35. Thank you for your pure heart, which inspires me daily, and is deserving of all love, including whatever I can give. You might think I am your keeper; the roles are reversed.
36. Thank you for being the light of my life. I have seen you from tadpole to frog: I changed your diapers, and will surely lend you some money some day.
37. Thank you for never failing to be there, in the most literal sense. The Constant in my multivariable life.
38. Thank you for teaching me friendship, loyalty. Thank you for showing me what a family looks like, both the one who raised you and the one you raise now.
39. Thank you for teaching me resilience, and so much more. You are the strongest person I know, and the most amusing. I look at life through your eyes, in my darkest and brightest moments.
40. Thank you for being the guiding light; your love, unending, passes through and makes me whole.
41. Thank you for showing me how to live life with joy; and thank you for letting me be there when you cannot.
42. Thank you for your brilliance, inspiring and matched by a ferocious heart.
43. Thank you for your everlasting encouragement, your inability to not embrace life.
44. Thank you for introducing me to the wide world of being a grown-up.
45. Thank you for being the mind that I must expend the least on to be heard; it is always a joy to pick up.
46. Thank you for loving me. With you is my salvation, my greatest blessing from God. Thank you for making a life for me.
47. Home the first, where I learned everything; when I die, scatter me in the Kish, where my heart already lies.
48. Home the second, where I acculturated to displacement; love you more than I know, more important than I can see right now.
49. Home the third, where I grew into myself; the place I conquered with my walks, the place I know like the back of my hand; the receptacle to my dreams.
50. Home the fourth, where my dreams are poured; what privilege, what luck, what love in every hour. May I give back one-tenth to the world.
51. What are you but a meeting point of eternal loves? Is not your existence the result of generations of love? Our inheritance is love; it is bred in our bones, and in our highest gift from the ancestral forebears: our words, who, though made a priori, are skeletons until we infuse them with our spirit, which we decide by our love. Anything you say in the name of love has been tread upon by a billion other loves, yet here your line still imprints. Nothing else will feed your heart so well. Speak; what remains in our hearts festers. Are we but shored fragments? Do I speak in men's tongues? A screaming at the void, the confession that, projected onto the world, yet remains unsaid. If I speak and have not love, a prophet, a faith that shakes the earth; and yet not love. A message that curtails action; we admire, and keep our distance. You do not love; you are nothing. Out there, for everyone to see, your words might deaden desire, deaden fruition, deaden love. Yet it is patient. It is kind. At our best, we are a mere silent medium for that speech; at our worst, we hurt and broke, and we cannot fix. It does not delight in evil. What are We but hiders? It never fails. Twenty four thousand and nine hundred ninety nine times so far (a lie, we skipped a few), have we added, more than subtracted? We can only do better tomorrow. Now we see the greatest of these, in fullness and charity. You are kind and beautiful and worthy of all respect. May we always let you know that. Lay down to sleep, comfortable in the arms that ought to protect you. For I speak in the tongues of angels, appropriated entirely, with love.
52. Always a tomorrow. Always another chance to exude love. In every crevice, every lost minute; with a smile, a deed, a word. The more there is, the lighter the world is. Do it with care, with authenticity. Love as much as you can, as often as you can, as deeply as you can, and beautiful things will happen."

@Box Brothers, a girl is trying to shoot her shot. Please confirm the relationship status of your members so I shoot in the right direction. Thanks.

I spoke on the phone to my mom for three hours straight. She hung up, finally. I didn't want her to hang up tho. I wish she had the time to talk me to sleep, I wish so badly, but.. she has responsibilities back home and even though I know she's worried about my condition and my state of mind and would love to keep on talking to me, simply for my petty wants, because I know she can hear it in the painful want of my voice, I just know it, thing is, she can't. She hangs up and messages me "Go to bed sweety". She has to take my sister to the dentist. That's what I hate. Not my siblings. I'm not jealous one bit. Quite frankly, I don't really feel much anything for them except for an indifferent deference that I present to every bystander in my life. I hate how my mom is so tied to her responsibilities, so engrossed in her daily chores that she is unable to even momentarily escape and realize that maybe, just maybe something special is happening here. Maybe I'm breaking the fourth wall. Maybe in my tipsy stupor I was making progress, i was actually making progress, unravelling whatever stupid formalities, whatever culture-ridden don't fart in public, masturbate in private SHIT still exists. But no. Routine, life, fucking dentist appointments take precedence and that's a shame. I really mean it. Every single time I return home for break, I feel like: ok, yes, now I'm new and improved, a changed man. I go home with the conviction: this time, yes this time  it's gonna be different, this time I'm gonna be absolutely open with my parents, we're gonna be like best friends, I'm gonna break that stupid barrier of formality. Heck I'll even tell them who my crush is. Fuck it, But no. Inspiration, like this itty bitty line, is but a momentary glimpse of what could be.

You then walked away and the squeaks continued. Presumably, you had more rubber duckies up your sleeves. Who were you two?

You know how sometimes you look at someone who doesn't fit the traditional (or your personal) standards of beauty, and it might be the thousandth time you've looked at them, but in that moment you're suddenly struck by how beautiful they are in their own way? It's a funny feeling to truly see someone for the first time.

To the beautiful human who covered my coffee at the SciLi this morning when I forgot my ID: Thank you thank you thank you <3 I was running late so I didn't properly find out who are you are but you made me cry because that was the nicest thing a random stranger has ever done for me at this sad, lonely school. Have a beautiful day and thank you for being a ray of sunshine!

Ethan Wold -- you're cute. Bubble tea and self deprecatory memes sometime?

I don't know if this is the right platform for this but I feel as though it needs to be said: To anyone who has ever been rejected - asking someone on a date, making a move on a stranger at a party, or even proposing a casual hangout to someone you kind of know from class - it sucks. I know it sucks. We have all been there. But no matter how hurt or embarrassed you might be, you need to respect that person's decision. Consent is a two-way street. Getting rejected is no excuse to lash out at someone and ruin their week, their relationships with friends, or their reputation. Be mindful of what you say to them and to other people you might seek out for comfort since backlash against the person you asked might lead them to self-destructive behavior in the future (like unhealthy attitudes about sex and dating, or a feeling like they've simply lost the power to consent). This person probably cares about you and you most likely care about them as well. Life is too short to burn bridges for stupid reasons so love your friends and don't drag people down as a method of coping.

To those that have ever rejected someone - I've been there too. It's a really hard thing to do, especially when there's a friendship on the line and you feel like you'll be hurting them if you say no, but hurting them more in the long run if you say yes and don't mean it. I wish I had some sort of advice to give here but I don't. As hard as it is to make the initial ask, sometimes the answer can be pretty difficult too. I guess just try to keep in mind that there are two sides to every coin - do what you think and feel you should do, but do it in a way that is respectful and appreciative of the other person.

That's about it for the rant. I've never posted on here before so that was a little bit of catharsis for me with regards to some stuff I've been dealing with so thanks for reading."

Goodbye Grandpa Miller, hello Daddy Stein

I still can't get over the idea that I'm unlovable and worthless because I've never been in a relationship before. Is this normal and should I be worried?

Update: denim jacket boy with glasses was wearing a red Canada goose in the scili....who?

to be honest, neither of us was ready for a relationship. I know we haven't talked since and I regret the way things ended. can we go back to the way things were? I deleted your number so I guess it's up to you to reach out now if you still feel the same way

Max Cooper - you make me feel hella warm and fuzzy inside

I saw Rushil Kumbhani at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?"

I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

To the guy at the gym with the United States flag towel, dude you're killing it and I think you run more in a day than I do in a week. It's super impressive and motivates me to work harder at the gym too so thank you!

Latest update on blond athletic (stoner?) boy: spotted walking by granoff in a red rain jacket around noon on Monday, April 4. Surely this narrows it down, people!

Also feel like I am crushing on a close friend that maybe likes me back, but also is  way too awesome for me, and for most tbh, and will soon realize that. I wasn't even supposed to actually like her this much to begin with. Either way, keep doing you, you're great and I am so happy to have met you :)

Hello my sweet friend! I need your help!

In light of the humanitarian disaster currently taking place in Syria, let us send some love and positivity to the brave survivors who are fighting for life every day. Hospitals are supposed to be places to treat people- a place that gives you a second chance at life, but hospitals have become weaponized in the Syrian war, 1/2 of all hospitals are no longer operable due to the attacks. Hundreds of women, men, and young children are losing their lives every day. It is time we all open our hearts, raise our voices, and show some solidarity!

We ask that you take a video where you:

1.     Assemble a group of people from your university or workplace

2.     Stand together and hold hands as a show of solidarity

3.     Hold up a sign that reads ‚Äò#HOSPITALSARENOTTARGETS" from ""your University Name or City, Country""

4.     Say in unison: Hospitals are not targets!

5.     Upload on social media by 4/20 and share! (remember to tag@Avicenna Women & Children Underground Hospital)



Our team is collaborating with SIMRO: Sustainable International Medical Relief Organization to host a fundraiser at Brown University where we will raise money for Syrian a telehealth solution to provide specialized healthcare for Syrian women and children. Our representatives in Syria will be talking with Syrian women and children, who will share their stories through a live stream that will be broadcasted at the fundraiser.

In return, we would like to show them that we truly care and we stand by them. This is your golden opportunity to show support to our Syrian friends. We hope it will brighten their day, publicize the weaponization of healthcare in Syria and raise money for desperately need medical care. Thank you for all you are and all you do! <3 Please SHARE this message and help up spread awareness and togetherness!

Gavin Petty: you manage that stage

I love how Brown encourages a community of being honest about emotions, instead of just lying and hiding everything, but it's made me realize how Brown has the densest community of people struggling mentally/emotionally I think I've ever been in in my life. It's definitely comforting to have so many similarly experienced people to offer me their support, but... wow. It makes me sad how many of us were forced onto this path towards Brown, or dove into our academics to cope with things or prove ourselves, or came here specifically because it was where all the ""weirdos"" like us were, or feel as though we've never really belonged here academically or socially.
So I just want to send some love out to everyone on campus. Life is a fucking bitch, and I'm glad you've made it this far. I know it's cheesy as hell to say to remember that people are here for you, that there are people around who will understand at least a little what you're going through, but I deeply feel that to be true.
Here's to us, trying our best."

I admire myself. I'm nice, funny, and, after suffering through puberty, pretty good looking. Go me.

I can't stop thinking about you. Not because I'm not over you but because there are like 20 other guys on campus that look like you.

My girlfriend goes to school in California, and we've been dating for about a year and a half now, but I don't think I love her as much as she loves me.

Any advice for a guy just looking for happiness would help.

Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday"

Sometimes I think I know my friends and then the next second they send me on a full mental breakdown. I can't believe they would just choose the guy over me. . .I see how much I matter now. I'm just so sick and tired of everything.

I'm looking for some advice on how to make new friends. Basically I've just stayed with the same group all year, but I'm not happy with them and it's pretty obvious they're not happy with me either. It's completely my fault for just accepting my situation for so long and pretending it was going to get better instead of working to fix it, but at this point I'm just not sure how to branch out. I'm in clubs, I go to parties most weekends, and I try to spend as little time in my room as possible, but I've just been having such a hard time actually making friends for some reason. Does anyone have any specific tips on what worked for you?

3 weeks ago, I woke up from a blackout in my bed to a purple pot of mac and cheese and a metal spoon next to me.

So, to the person whose pot and spoon I stole from the grad center C 3rd floor kitchen, I sincerely apologize, and your pot and spoon have been returned :) also im single

Asian girl who sits at back of class in engn with black hair and always wears hats: single?

Every time Prof. Art Salomon chuckles or says "I love you guys," my heart stops. What a kind soul.

A friend of mine showed me this page, and he encouraged me to share my own story, as it was (in his words) ""the most romantic story I'd ever heard.""

In the early 2000s, I was an engineering concentrator at Brown who also took French classes. One summer, feeling kind of sick of looking at circuits, I decided to study abroad in Paris. My first week there was dreadful. I didn't fit in with the other people in my program, and my classes weren't as great as I expected them to be. I even found myself missing Barus and Holley. One night, I walked out of my dormitory so that, for the fourth straight night, I could order a sandwich at the bistro down the street.

That's where I first saw her. A few seconds after I walked in and got in line, a pretty girl with black hair, thin lips, and the most beautiful brown eyes you'd ever seen came into the bistro. I gave my order, and she must have noticed my accent, because she started a conversation with me in English. Somehow, we ended up sitting at that bistro eating dinner together.

A student at the Sorbonne enjoying a carefree summer, she lived a few streets away from me. We spent almost every free moment we had with each other - walking underneath the Eiffel Tower, touring the galleries at the Louvre, lazing away in the shadow of Sacre-Coeur. It was idyllic and unbelievable, and I had finally found a friend. Pretty soon, of course, she became more than a friend - but my program finished after eight weeks, and I had to go back to New York. On that last night, she lay in my arms, and we decided not to try long distance, but to remain friends for as long as we could.

And, believe it or not, we corresponded via email for the next seven years, sending each other messages every month at least. Though we never saw each other, she was with me through my first shitty job, a countless stream of girlfriends, and the death of my mother; I was with her through her own first ten shitty jobs, a long-term boyfriend who didn't always treat her well, and the passing of several cats. She became my best friend - but always, in the back of my mind, she was more than that.

Then one day, by chance, my company sent me to London for travel. I hadn't been abroad since that summer. I asked if, maybe, she wanted to meet again. I took the Chunnel to France, and met her on a beautiful Saturday morning in a cafe on the Seine. It was the best day of my life, but the worst night - because I had to go back to London, and take an early flight home the next day. As she hugged and then kissed me goodbye, I knew that I couldn't possibly just be her correspondent anymore. The moment I landed at JFK the next day, I was ready to email her, telling her that it was too hard to keep talking when we couldn't be together.

Alas, there was a message in my inbox from her, with a single question. ""Why don't you move to Paris?"" I couldn't think of any reasons why not. I started looking for jobs there, and a painful eighteen months later she met me at Charles De Gaulle.

Now it was my turn to ask her a question.

Elle a dit oui."

Daddy Swax, take me on a date

Josh Amaya - I wish we were better friends! Hope you had a great spring break :)

Any single althelets out there named Will... asking for a friend (p.s. William is fine too)

As a PoC, it is exhausting to be friends with even very liberal whites. Though they proclaim to, they will never fully understand the difficulties that PoC face nor do the majority of them ever seem to be fully on board with pushing for for racial equity/equality at the expense of their own privilege. Concept: just as PoC don't deserve to be less privileged than whites, white people dont deserve more privilege than PoC. Unfortunately, most of them don't realize they have this viewpoint.

I really wish that I could have gotten the same sense of support from my white friends at Brown as I have my PoC friends. It is just so fully exhausting and isolating to be graduating with the feeling that about half if not more of my friends don't fully support equality and equity, let alone support me.

White people with PoC friends, please try to do a better job listening to us when we speak. Like many of you, most of us have thought through our opinions and positions and they are based in rational thought. It's rude to assume your positions are somehow more logical or rational. They arent- they just come from a very different perspective."

I'm really sad because I feel like no matter how progressive Brown is and how ~woke~ all the friends I've made are... there is still soooo much fatphobia and it's really damaging and toxic to me... even if people aren't saying comments in a spiteful or purposefully negative way, I feel that the culture around food, exercise, fashion (and don't even get me started on dating) are really fatphobic I'm so many ways...

Kobe- your presence in my life is such a light during dark times. Your friendship is invaluable to me, and is one of the most special and authentic things about my life. You understand me and support me in a way no one else can, and there aren't words to express my appreciation for that. Your strength and determination inspire me to keep trucking and to celebrate the small victories. I love and appreciate you! <3

What happens when you swipe right on someone you know and have class with and actually like?

Listen up, BBA readers. There's this guy I've seen around campus approximately once a month since my first year. He's got shaggy dirty blond hair, he's almost definitely an athlete, probably a track runner, and he always looks like he's high (or maybe he is always high). I am SO attracted to this dude. Someone please identify him for me so I can ask his fine ass out. Tag all your friends who even vaguely fit this description plz & thank u.

Caitlin Malimban is actually the best person I know.

Sabrina is the cutest damn person I've ever seen, single?

Indian boy with the partly bleached hair??

Ben Styler. How do I express the pure passion that I feel for you? The first time I saw you, your muscles bulged from under your sweater, your confident smile beaming across the main green. Your dark brown eyes swirled like melted chocolate, taking my breath away. I can't bring myself to believe you're single, because how could such an Adonis possibly not be drowning in women? Ben, I think about you everyday. You give me the strength to challenge myself, to become a better person. If you read this, just know you are an absolute daddy.

Anabella Sherman is one of the most level-headed, modest people I know. She never makes a big deal of herself or her talents even though she really is so talented. No one would know that she is an astonishing actress if it weren't for this post, so I wanted to let the world know.

Krishna Bellam is stand-up guy. He has really been a role model since the first day I met him in the curry line in Drews. Even though I barely knew him, he seemed so nice and friendly. I even let him and his friend get in front of me in the  line. We had a conversation and I learned a lot about him, who we was, what he stood up for, and what he valued. Respect is all I could think. Man, I saw some of myself in Krishna, even though everything I thought I was good at, he was better. I envied him in a admirable, inspiring way.

Krishna, keep it up man. You really have something going for you mate."

Hi Brown! So I'm feeling kind of ..left behind by all of my friends because they went on fun trips for spring break and I couldn't afford to join them ..I mean, I also wasn't invited but I'm going to pretend that this break ended up this way just because I couldn't afford it. Because of that, I'm bored. Feeling neglected by everyone else having a blast. It's my third spring break that's ended up this way. Any advice?

how does one find a nice boy like Alex Adia???

We've been so close since freshman year and I know we're growing apart for the better, but I can't imagine what Brown would be like without you

Julia Rosenberg, I saw you outside of Perkins on Friday and was going to talk to you, but you were on the phone with somebody. You're the coolest person ever and I'd be honored to make your acquaintance

It's been three days without Daddy Metz and I feel empty.  Physically.

I don't want to tag names because we all have that Piglet to our Winnie the Pooh, that Tigger that makes laugh, the Eeyore that is always sleepy and emo (sometimes), the Kanga that nonstop cares for us and forces us to take our meds, the Roo that is always confused and childish but makes us feel youthful, the Rabbit that is forever frustrated at us for doing foolish things but still has that soft and loving side at heart, the wise old owl who gives us constant advice, and finally, the Christopher Robins who keeps us always on our toes, alive, and together. To all the friends out there like my own Hundred-Acre-Wood gang of friends, you are the most loving and supportive people around. Through times when I am down, through moments when I didn't want to show how vulnerable, afraid, and alone I was, you guys were always there to support and love me for who I am. I wouldn't have asked for anyone better, anything greater. Thank you for reminding me who I am when I lost myself, for giving me strength to be strong, powerful, and independent. Here's to my friends <3 <3 <3

Looking for the dream team fortnite squad.  Tag yourself.

I went on this date with a really sweet guy. Well, he was definitely sweet in person. But he's insanely socially awkward, so much so he's self aware of his inhibitions and openly admits them (which I think is extremely laudable). But I don't understand what he wants, whether he actually likes me or if he's just looking for some attention at the moment. And we're such opposites--I'm extremely extroverted and out there. What do I do? I want to give him a second chance, but he's so aloof and I don't know if that's because of his inhibitions.

So like y'all really be fucking inside of blueno or is this just a joke? Confused freshmen here

Response to 24492: I'm gay and im stats hit me up ;)
